    "➤ Sharing Snacks - Imagine you have 15 delicious cookies, and you want to share them with your 3 friends. You can use Python's division to find out how many cookies each friend will get. It's a fair way to split the snacks!\n",

    "➤ Making Patterns - You can use Python's multiplication to create fun patterns with numbers. For example, if you want to draw three rows of smiley faces, and each row has four smileys, you can use multiplication to figure out how many smileys you need in total.\n",

    "➤ Saving Money - If you receive some pocket money each week, you can use Python's addition to keep track of how much money you've saved over time. Each week, add the new amount to the total, and you'll know how much money you have in your piggy bank!"
